todo CLEAN THE CODE
todo CLEAN METADATA

* rarityList can contain 3,2,1 types; if the rareCounter tells include the subset
* of any one, eg: if rareCounter selects NFT to include 'original' (meaning the NFT will)
* be original, then no 'rare' or 'super_rare' elements can be added in.
! this can be solved by giving equal percentage to each rarity

todo Connect to 'Django' website (make a blueprint)
todo Add progress bar using JS for finished NFTs
todo Can change input and output folder 
todo Modify the metadata from layers - desc, url

*    DJANGO (uses and work)
*    URLs redirect to list project
!    Rest framework + Opensea Api = NFT Api (for customer use) (BUT OPENSEA API CAN DO IT)
*    Opensea + Discord Bot + Instagram + Twitter (APIs) = to post/list project
!    Or else can use third-party software to post on socials (D,I,T)
